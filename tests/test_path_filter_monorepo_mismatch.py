"""Regression tests for path_filter behavior with monorepo-style roots.

These tests ensure that when the database base_directory is a higher-level
monorepo root, path_filter values that are repo-relative segments (missing
the leading repository name) still successfully scope semantic search.

Scenario:
    base_directory: /tmp/.../workspace
    stored file path: "orion-suite/services/engine/src/EngineModule.py"

We want:
    search_semantic(query, path_filter="services/engine")
to return results from that file, even though the stored path includes the
leading "orion-suite/" segment.
