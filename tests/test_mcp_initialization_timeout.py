"""Test MCP server initialization timeout behavior.

This test reproduces the VS Code MCP integration issue where the server
hangs during initialization due to synchronous directory scanning.

IMPORTANT: This file contains stress tests that create thousands of files
and directories to test performance under load. The large stress tests are
automatically skipped in CI environments due to GitHub Actions I/O
limitations.

To run stress tests locally:
  pytest tests/test_mcp_initialization_timeout.py -v

To run only the stress tests:
  pytest tests/test_mcp_initialization_timeout.py -k "large or deep" -v
