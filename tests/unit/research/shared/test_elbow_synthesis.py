"""Unit tests for elbow-based chunk filtering and proportional cluster budgets.

Tests the Kneedle algorithm for elbow detection and proportional budget allocation
for cluster synthesis. These are core algorithms used in the research pipeline.

Elbow Detection:
    Uses find_elbow_kneedle() to detect natural breakpoints in relevance scores,
    enabling adaptive filtering of low-relevance chunks.

Proportional Budgets:
    Allocates output tokens to clusters proportional to their input size,
    ensuring larger clusters (more code) receive more output budget.
