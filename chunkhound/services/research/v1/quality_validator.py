"""Quality validation for deep research outputs.

This module provides quality control mechanisms for synthesis outputs including:
- Verbosity filtering: Remove common LLM meta-commentary and defensive patterns
- Quality validation: Check for theoretical placeholders, citation density, and vague measurements
- Citation validation: Ensure proper numbered reference citations
- Citation sorting: Sort consecutive citation sequences for readability

Quality checks act as safety nets even with good prompting, ensuring outputs are
concrete, well-cited, and actionable rather than vague or theoretical.
