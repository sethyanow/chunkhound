"""Context management for deep research service.

This module handles tracking explored context during BFS traversal:
- Collecting ancestor data from parent nodes
- Updating global explored state across the BFS graph
- Building exploration summaries for follow-up generation
- Detecting duplicate chunks to avoid redundant exploration
- Detecting new information vs previously explored content
