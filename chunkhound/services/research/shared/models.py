RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # Lower threshold for better recall, reranking will filter
NODE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.2  # Reserved for future similarity-based deduplication (currently uses LLM)
MAX_FOLLOWUP_QUESTIONS = 3

REGEX_AUGMENTATION_RATIO = 0.3  # Regex results = 30% of semantic count
REGEX_MIN_RESULTS = 20  # Min regex results (ensures value when semantic low)

# Import resolution default scores
# Import-resolved chunks don't have rerank scores, so we assign defaults.
# Lower values = more conservative ranking (won't outrank actual search results)
IMPORT_DEFAULT_SCORE = 0.3  # Phases 1, 1.5, 2: discovered early, higher priority
IMPORT_SYNTHESIS_SCORE = 0.2  # Phase 3: late discovery imports, lower priority

# Adaptive token budgets (depth-dependent)
ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_BUDGETS = True  # Enable depth-based adaptive budgets

# File content budget range (input: what LLM sees for code)
FILE_CONTENT_TOKENS_MIN = 10_000  # Root nodes (synthesizing, need less raw code)
FILE_CONTENT_TOKENS_MAX = 50_000  # Leaf nodes (analyzing, need full implementations)

# LLM total input budget range (query + context + code)
LLM_INPUT_TOKENS_MIN = 15_000  # Root nodes
LLM_INPUT_TOKENS_MAX = 60_000  # Leaf nodes

# Leaf answer output budget (what LLM generates at leaves)
# NOTE: Reduced from 30k to balance cost vs quality. If you observe:
#   - Frequent "Missing: [detail]" statements
#   - Theoretical placeholders ("provide exact values")
#   - Incomplete analysis of complex components
# Consider increasing these values. Quality validation warnings will indicate budget pressure.
LEAF_ANSWER_TOKENS_BASE = 18_000  # Base budget for leaf nodes (was 30k, reduced for cost)
LEAF_ANSWER_TOKENS_BONUS = 3_000  # Additional tokens for deeper leaves (was 5k, reduced for cost)

# NOTE: Reduced from 17.5k/32k to balance cost vs quality. If root synthesis appears rushed or
# omits critical architectural details, consider increasing INTERNAL_ROOT_TARGET.

INTERNAL_MAX_TOKENS = 19_000  # Maximum for deep internal nodes (was 32k, reduced for cost)

# Follow-up question generation output budget (what LLM generates for follow-up questions)
# NOTE: High budgets needed for reasoning models (o1/o3/GPT-5) which use internal "thinking" tokens
# WHY: Reasoning models consume 5-15k tokens for internal reasoning before producing 100-500 tokens of output
# The actual generated questions are concise, but the model needs reasoning budget to evaluate relevance
FOLLOWUP_OUTPUT_TOKENS_MIN = 8_000  # Root/shallow nodes: simpler questions, less reasoning needed
FOLLOWUP_OUTPUT_TOKENS_MAX = 15_000  # Deep nodes: complex synthesis requires more reasoning depth

# Utility operation output budgets (for reasoning models like o1/o3/GPT-5)
# These operations use utility provider and don't vary by depth
# WHY: Each utility operation produces small output but requires reasoning budget for quality

SINGLE_PASS_OVERHEAD_TOKENS = 5_000  # Prompt template and overhead
SINGLE_PASS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 600  # 10 minutes timeout for large synthesis calls
# Available for code/chunks: Scales dynamically with repo size (30k-150k input tokens)

# Target output length (controlled via prompt instructions, not API token limits)
# WHY: OUTPUT_TOKENS_WITH_REASONING is FIXED at 30k for all queries (reasoning models need this)
# This allows reasoning models to use thinking tokens while producing appropriately sized output
# NOTE: Only INPUT budget scales dynamically based on repository size, output is fixed
TARGET_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 15_000  # Default target for standard research outputs

# NOTE: Elbow Detection Replaces Repo-Size Scaling (2024-12)
# The v1 synthesis engine now uses Kneedle algorithm elbow detection to determine
# the relevance cutoff for chunks, rather than scaling input budgets based on
# repository size (LOC). This provides data-driven cutoffs based on actual
# score distributions rather than arbitrary size-based thresholds.
