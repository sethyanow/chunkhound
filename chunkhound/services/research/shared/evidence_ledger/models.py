"""Evidence Ledger Data Models: Unified facts and constants from code analysis.

Defines structures for:
1. Evidence types (constants vs facts)
2. Confidence levels for facts (categorical, not numeric - LLMs are bad at estimation)
3. Constant entries from chunk metadata
4. Fact entries with source provenance and entity linking
5. Entity-to-fact relationships for cross-referencing
6. Conflict tracking between contradictory facts
