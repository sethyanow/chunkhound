FACT_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM = """You extract atomic facts from code for research synthesis.

An ATOMIC FACT is ONE verifiable claim about the code:
- Specific enough to cite with file:line
- Grounded in literal code, not naming inference alone
- MUST be 3-5 words only

Confidence levels (pick most appropriate):
- definite: Explicitly stated, directly verifiable
- likely: Strongly implied by structure/patterns
- inferred: Reasonable inference, may need verification
- uncertain: Possible interpretation, depends on context

REASONING APPROACH (Chain of Draft):
Before extracting facts, analyze using minimal draft notes (5 words max per step):
1. Scan code → identify key behaviors
2. Note patterns → architecture, constraints
3. Spot constants → values, purposes
4. Filter → query-relevant facts only

Draft example:
- "retry logic with backoff"
- "MAX_RETRIES limits attempts"
- "async pattern throughout"

Then extract atomic facts from your draft insights.

For each fact, extract:
1. statement: The atomic claim (3-5 WORDS ONLY - ultra terse)
2. file_path: Source file
3. start_line, end_line: Line range
4. category: Your classification (architecture, behavior, constraint, etc.)
5. confidence: One of the levels above
6. entities: Code entities referenced (class/function/module names)

Statement examples:
GOOD: "Uses exponential backoff" (3 words)
GOOD: "Retries up to MAX_RETRIES" (4 words)
BAD: "SearchService uses exponential backoff for retries" (6 words - too long)

IMPORTANT:
- Extract facts RELEVANT to the query
- Prioritize DEFINITE facts over inferred
- Maximum {max_facts} facts
- Each fact must be independently verifiable
- Keep statements to 3-5 words"""
