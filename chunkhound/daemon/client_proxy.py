"""Stdio ↔ IPC bridge — the lightweight proxy run by each Claude instance.

Each ``chunkhound mcp`` invocation (in daemon mode) becomes a ClientProxy that:
1. Discovers or starts the daemon.
2. Connects to the daemon via the IPC transport (Unix socket or TCP loopback).
3. Performs the registration handshake.
4. Bidirectionally forwards stdin ↔ IPC and IPC ↔ stdout.

The proxy actively encodes/decodes: it bridges two different transports:
    stdio (JSON-RPC newline-delimited) ↔ IPC (length-prefixed msgpack/JSON frames)
