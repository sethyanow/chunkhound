"""Centralized language detection for ChunkHound.

ARCHITECTURE:
- Single source of truth for all language detection
- Multi-stage strategy: content → extension → filename → fallback
- Handles ambiguous extensions (.m for ObjC/MATLAB)

USAGE:
    from chunkhound.core.detection import detect_language
    language = detect_language(file_path)

RATIONALE:
- Prevents scattered detection logic across services
- Makes adding new ambiguous extensions trivial
- Single point of maintenance and testing
